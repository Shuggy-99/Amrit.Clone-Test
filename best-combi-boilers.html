								<h2>What is a combi boiler?</h2>
								<p>A <a href="">combi or combination boiler</a> combines a water heating system and central heating unit into a single body, acting as a unified way to handle heating and hot water without needing two separate boilers.</p>
								<p>This means there is <b>no need for a separate water tank system</b> and therefore takes up less space in your home. A combi boiler is one of the most efficient types of combi boilers to install and tends to be much more reliable than normal combi boilers which is why we love them so much!</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-05" id="title-05">
								<h2>Combi boilers are suitable for most properties</h2>
								<p><b>A combi boiler is the best option for almost all properties because it can be easily installed onto the water mains and offer instant control of heating in your home.</b></p>
								<p>Whether your current combi boiler is on the blink or not, all combi boilers need to be replaced every 10 to 15 years. This means that even if you are not currently experiencing problems with your old combi boiler, but it has been in your home for more than a decade, it is time to consider what combi boiler can replace it.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-06" id="title-06">
								<h2>Why should I buy a new boiler?</h2>
								<p>According to the <a href="">Energy Saving Trust</a>, if your combi boiler is over fifteen years old and is a non-condensing boiler, it will be less efficient and may become faulty and even break down on a regular basis, as a result of corrosion on internal components from the thermal and mechanical stresses over years of constant use.</p>
								<p>Not only is this an inconvenience for you, but it could also be costing you a lot more money to run an old inefficient boiler that frequently requires costly repairs, than it would to run a new A-Class efficiency rated combi boiler.</p>
								<p>According to The Energy Saving Trust, you could start saving up to £340 annually on your energy bills by replacing your combi boiler</p>
								<p>You can also have a read up on <a href="">new boiler costs</a> and how you could save money.</p>

							<section class="title-07" id="title-07">
								<h2>Which combi boiler should I buy?</h2>
								<p>There are so many combi boiler brands and models to choose from, that deciding on which combi boiler is best for you, might seem impossible.</p>

								<p>Combi boilers are also available at many different price points, which is another factor to consider when preparing to make a purchase.</p>
									
								<p>That’s why we have researched and read plenty of reviews to compile our <b>Top Best Combi Boilers of 2022</b>, with reasons why we love them so much. Keep reading to find out our favourite!</p>

								<h2>How to find the best combi boiler?</h2>
								<p>While we have highlighted our top five combis for 2022, there may come a time when you need to shop for a unit on your own.</p>
								<p><b>There are certain features you should look out for when shopping for combi boilers, including:</b></p>
								<p><b>01.</b> Energy Efficiency</p>
								<p><b>02.</b> Power Outage</p>
								<p><b>03.</b> Size</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-09" id="title-09">
								<h2>Energy efficiency of your combi boiler</h2>
								<p>Combi boilers are given a grade based on how energy-efficient they are, with an A rating being the highest.</p>
								<p>This is a good thing to consider because it will determine how expensive the boiler will be to run. A more energy-efficient boiler could potentially save you money over time.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-10" id="title-10">
								<h2>Power outage of the combi boiler</h2>
								<p>The power outage of a combi boiler is listed as kW, and this determines the size of the boiler. Smaller homes tend to benefit from a boiler of between 25kW and 30kW, but this is something your gas engineer can help you with.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-11" id="title-11">
								<h2>Size of the combi boiler</h2>
								<p>You will need a combi boiler that is large enough to handle your home heating.</p>
								<p>The physical size of a combi boiler unit is important to consider too, as this will determine whether the unit can be installed into your home safely.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-12" id="title-12">
								<h2>How much does a new combi boiler cost?</h2>
								<p><b>The average cost of getting a new combi boiler is between £1,500 and £3,000.</b></p>
								<p>However the cost of a boiler can vary depending on the brand and the type.</p>
								<p>When you get a new combi boiler, there are various costs involved that you need to consider along with the price of the unit itself.</p>
								<p>Buying a boiler includes installation costs, labour costs, and potentially any additional parts as well as the price of the boiler itself.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-13" id="title-13">
								<h2>Different gas companies offer varying prices based on boiler location, availability, and your location.</h2>
								<p>For example, those in London will have to pay higher costs than those in the North even if they are getting the exact same combi boiler installed.</p>
								<p>The type of home that you live in can also alter the cost of getting a new combi boiler, such as whether you live in a terraced or semi-detached property.</p>
								<p>Boiler engineers will also need to consider how many bedrooms and bathrooms are in your home to gauge not only the kind of combi boiler you need but also the cost of installation.</p>

								<h2>#5 Alpha Combi Boilers</h2>

								<p>This means you are guaranteed a high quality combi boiler, despite the low prices. They offer a range of combi boiler sizes from the compact E-Tec to the larger E-Tec Plus which deliver on every aspect.</p>
								<p>Alpha Boilers are not the quite the best combi boiler on the market but are amazing budget option if cash is a little tight and you still want a solid boiler which is built to last.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-16" id="title-16">
								<h2>Great budget boiler</h2>
								<p>Alpha Boilers are a budget option, but manage to balance price with some reliable design decisions to give you a cheap but fairly consistent boiler line.</p>
								<p>The Italian design and surprisingly useful parts and labour warranties mean that each combi boiler is usually going to work just fine in the long-term.</p>
								<p>A great set of sales and support staff also gives you an easy way to contact them if something goes wrong, and specific boilers have warranties of up to ten years, depending on the model you choose.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-17" id="title-17">
								<h2>Italian quality</h2>
								<p>While Alpha Boilers may be relatively cheap, they are not poor-quality, so they can become a great mid-range choice when you do not want to go too high or low.</p>
								<p>Other than that, there is not much else to say about Alpha Boilers, because they are a comfortable middle-of-the-road option that can fit into most homes and businesses without issue.</p>
								<p>You are also covered for much longer than the price would suggest, so wear and tear are not as much of a setback. If purchased through iHeat you also get a massive 10 year warranty on all Alpha boilers.</p>

								<h2>#4 Ideal Combi Boilers</h2>
								<p>In fourth place comes Ideal. This boiler brand is the best at small and affordable boilers such as the Logic range as well as flashier pricier models such as the Vogue range, catering for all their customers and their budgets.</p>
								<p>Ideal Boilers has seen rapid growth over the last ten years, and offer a very simple warranty system that gives combi boilers either 2, 7, or 10-year warranties depending on which model you are buying.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-25" id="title-25">
								<h2>Built to last</h2>
								<p>In terms of quality, they sit around the same level as Worcester Bosch but with a slightly lower price, which can make them more budget-friendly if you are trying to save every penny you can.</p>
								<p>Of course, this price depends on the installer, so the cost of getting a combi boiler form Ideal Boilers can vary by location.</p>
								<p>When compared side by side, they are a good alternative to Worcester Bosch, and many of their ranges are similar enough to stand in for WB combi boilers if you need them.</p>
								<p><b>Looking for a mid-range boiler then Ideal may be the Ideal choice</b></p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-26" id="title-26">
								<h2>Solid price</h2>
								<p>A mid-range price and a compact design ensure that these combi boilers can be used in a wide variety of locations and situations, often knocking around 10% off the price when compared to more expensive brands.</p>
								<p>However, this comes at the cost of not necessarily having the exact same features, so you may lose out on some unique benefits here and there.</p>
								<p>Even still, Ideal combi boilers could end up offering you the best combi boiler depending on what you are looking for and how large your budget is.</p>
								<p>They may be cheaper than other choices, but that does not make them worse or less reliable.</p>

								<p>However, they do come with a convenient app to control your heating anytime, anywhere and have a 5 year warranty which can be upgraded to 7 or 10 years.</p>
								<p>Valliant is not mentioned quite as often as other top brands, but they operate at a similar level to Worcester Bosch, combining great quality with a variety of useful warranties and customer service options.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-34" id="title-34">
								<h2>Warranties</h2>
								<p>Warranties generally sit between 2-5 years in total, depending on the model, with a similar price range to other beloved brands.</p>
								<p>One of the main benefits of Valliant is the variety on offer: the ecoTEC combi boiler line has become a favourite for people who want lower energy consumption without losing performance, and the warranty can be upped to ten years with a Valliant Advance Installer.</p>
								<p>The improved efficiency can really help you save money, just like with Worcester Bosch combi boilers.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-35" id="title-35">
								<h2>Customer Service</h2>
								<p>Finally, great customer service is always useful, and Valliant is keen to offer it. If something goes wrong and you need help fixing a problem or identifying a failure, then it is not hard to get in contact with them, meaning that you will always have a way to contact the company and won't have to hunt down an obscure email address or phone number.</p>

								<h2>Vaillant ecoTEC exclusive</h2>
								<p>This combi boiler is great for larger homes with its higher outputs. It has the potential to generate an impressive 17.8 litres of hot water per minute and is eco-friendly and 85% recyclable. Like all of the Vaillant products, the ecoTEC exclusive has been Quiet Mark approved, meaning it is one of the quietest products on the market.</p>

								<p>The ecoFIT pure is another of Valliant’s highly efficient, smart control and high performance combi boilers but much more compact to fit in a kitchen cupboard in a smaller home.

								<h2>#2 Worcester Bosch Combi Boilers</h2>
								<p>In second place come the Worcester Bosch boilers, the pioneers of combi boilers. In 2019, they secured a Which? Best Buy award for the 10th year and their bestseller, the Greenstar i can be found in over a million UK homes.</p>
								<p><b>Worcester Bosch are a huge household name in the boiler game for a reason.. reliability! 🏆</b></p>
								<p>If you ask most people what the best combi boiler is, the Worcester Bosch group will come up every time. Worcester Bosch covers quite a range of boiler types and features, which means that they are suited to plenty of different situations.</p>
								<p>However, they are also consistent in terms of quality, so there is not any risk of a certain model being extremely poor or unreliable.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-42" id="title-42">
								<h2>Warranty</h2>
								<p>One of the biggest draws is their warranty offers. Depending on the exact boiler model you choose and the features included in the design, you can have a warranty of anywhere between five and ten years.</p>
								<p>This means that with Worcester Bosch you are covered in case something goes wrong, even if the fault only becomes obvious nine years after installation.</p>
								<p>Even better, installing more Worcester Bosch products can extend this warranty: adding their filter system to one of their combi boilers can add another year to your overall warranty time, which means that you get even more protection if you gradually upgrade your new combi boiler during the existing warranty period.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-43" id="title-43">
								<h2>Price</h2>
								<p>Higher quality often comes with higher prices, and Worcester Bosch used to be a major example. Over time, though, some of their models have become much more affordable, and there are monthly payment options for people who can’t afford an up-front cost.</p>
								<p>Getting Worcester Bosch combi boilers in 2022 can also be cheaper through third-party installers.</p>

It has a wide choice of simple to use controls and a temperature display, however, with having such a large unit, a large space such as underneath a kitchen counter is required.</p>

								<h2>#1 Viessmann (Our 1st Best Boiler Brand)</h2>
								<p>In first place comes <a href="">Viessmann</a>. Viessmann surpasses all other best combi boiler brands in the market with their advanced German engineering and efficient heating systems that are a great value for money.</p>

								<p>This isn't to say we don't think the other boilers listed in this article are not some of the best combi boilers on the market, the Viessmann is just the cream of the crop!</p>

							</section>
							<section class="title-51" id="title-51">
								<h2>Their prices are currently so low as they are still attempting to increase their exposure in Britain, so now really is the time to buy yours before the prices rise! Get your fixed quote here. Built to last</h2>
								<p>One of their key selling points is the longer lifespan, something that makes their combi boilers last much longer than a lot of competing products. Because of this, they will often appear near the top of any best combi boiler list.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-52" id="title-52">
								<h2>Efficiency</h2>
								<p>Efficiency can mean a lot when it comes to heating, which often makes Viessman a good choice for keeping costs low in the long-run.</p>
								<p>Even in designs that have a lower maximum heat output, the improved efficiency can save plenty of money and make better use of the power you are already consuming.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-53" id="title-53">
								<h2>Warranty</h2>
								<p>All of their models come with ten-year warranties when bought through iHeat, and there are simple finance options available for their more expensive offerings</p>

								<p>Even better, most are designed to be silent or near-silent when in use, which can make all the difference in a crowded home where the boiler can’t easily be tucked away.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-54" id="title-54">
								<h2>Price</h2>
								<p>In general, <b>Viessman is a great choice for a smaller building</b>, especially if you do not have as much room to store it.</p>

								<p>The higher efficiency removes a lot of the hassle from setting the combi boiler up and also means that there is more power packed into a single body.</p>

								<p>You can fit a lot of them into existing cupboards or small alcoves, and the long-lasting design prevents them from breaking down easily.</p>

								</ul>
							</section>
							<section class="title-62" id="title-62">
								<h2>Glow Worm Combi Boilers</h2>
								<p>Glow Worm are the exact opposite of the previous two choices: they might be somewhat simple, but they are also incredibly cheap, often appearing in rental properties and budget renovation projects.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-63" id="title-63">
								<h2>Reliability</h2>
								<p>Lower reliability can make them a risk in some cases, but they also come with warranties between two to five years, and installation is extremely straightforward.</p>
								<p>This gives you a very unique option for situations where a full boiler may not actually be needed, especially if you are actively planning to replace it with another boiler in the next few years.</p>
								<p>This niche is hard to fill with larger and more expensive options, making Glow Worm useful in the short-term.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-64" id="title-64">
								<h2>Low low prices</h2>
								<p>The very low cost can also make them a suitable choice in the long-term as long as you can keep replacing or repairing them.</p>
								<p>For example, if you are saving up money for a full house renovation and do not want to spend thousands on a top-tier combi boiler, one or two Glow Worm models can do the same job until you are ready to renovate the entire building.</p>
								<p>This does not make Glow Worm a bad choice, it just means that they are suited to particular situations. If you need cheap, straightforward and functional combi boilers, then it is a good place to start looking.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-65" id="title-65">
								<h2>Baxi Boilers</h2>
								<p>Baxi is another high-quality option that fits somewhere between Worcester Bosch, Valiant, and Ideal Boilers.</p>
								<p>Their boiler range includes combi boilers as well as other varieties, and all of them are relatively easy to install, coming in at a slightly lower price that makes them more affordable in the long-term.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-66" id="title-66">
								<h2>Qualify</h2>
								<p>Baxi combi boilers are <b>designed primarily for homes that do not demand a lot of hot water</b> all at once, meaning that they may not be as effective if you have two bathrooms or multiple hot taps that you are using at the same time.</p>
								<p>However, they are very small and can easily be installed almost anywhere in the average home, which makes them a perfect choice if you are looking for a compact solution.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-67" id="title-67">
								<h2>Efficiency</h2>
								<p>They also come with a variety of efficiency improvements and other benefits, which can lead to them becoming very useful if you are looking to keep your cost down and your heating functioning well.</p>
								<p>This combination of compact construction and reduced costs make them a great middle-ground option for most homeowners and ranks them as one of the best combi boiler.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-68" id="title-68">
								<h2>Potterton</h2>
								<p>Potterton gets high ratings but is not known all that well, and their recent changes to their combi boiler models have given them two distinct types of boiler.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-69" id="title-69">
								<h2>Durability</h2>
								<p>Older Potterton models are very durable, whereas newer ones are cheaper but lose some of their durability in the process.</p>
								<p>Even so, engineers often install them purely because of their excellent support, which makes it much easier to resolve faults or report issues that might be covered under warranties.</p>
								<p>They are also the cheapest of the top-tier boiler brands featured on this list, which can make them much more accessible without sacrificing too much in terms of quality.</p>

								<p>While Potterton may not be mentioned very often, that does not make them a bad choice, and there are many people who still swear by using them over and over again.</p>
								<p>They fill a niche for people who do not have a high budget but still want something more than cheaper options.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-70" id="title-70">
								<h2>Which combi boiler do I choose?</h2>
								<p>The problem with choosing the best combi boilers is that every homeowner can want different things.</p>
								<p><b>Combi boilers are meant to heat water and provide heating</b>, so it is obvious that they will need to do those basic things, but other features can really vary depending on what you are looking for.</p>
								<p>For example, some people are desperate for high-efficiency models that cost less to run, especially if they are already on a tight budget and do not want high heating bills that can eat into their savings.</p>
								<p>Other people have more than enough money to cover the bills and want higher heating speeds or temperatures instead.</p>
								<p>On top of that, there are some people who just want the lowest install price and do not care about the actual effectiveness of the boiler, especially in rental properties or homes that they are renovating. In many cases, a cheap boiler can be good holdover until you are ready to replace it with something more expensive.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-71" id="title-71">
								<h2>Price of a new combi boiler</h2>
								<p>If the price is all you care about, then the best combi boilers are the ones that do not cost much to install and cost even less to run. We do also have an in-depth blog on combi boiler costs to help you better decide when purchasing a new boiler.</p>
								<p>A cheap but inefficient boiler will add up over time, so something that is efficient and low-priced can be the best choice in terms of affordability.</p>
								<p>If you can get the boiler on a finance plan rather than with an upfront payment, this becomes even better.</p>
								<p>Remember that installation fees are sometimes a thing, so you’ll want to keep that in mind if you are not going to install the combi-boiler yourself.</p>
								<p>The more complex the process, the more it can cost, especially if you need new pipes and systems to be installed so that the boiler can connect properly.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-72" id="title-72">
								<h2>Size of the boiler</h2>
								<p>A bigger gas combi boiler can often be more powerful, but it also takes up more room and will generally make more noise.</p>
								<p>If a boiler is too bulky, then you will need space to keep it somewhere, and that can often mean that you will have to do more work opening up space in a wall or building something to cover it.</p>
								<p><b>On the other hand, a compact boiler can easily be fitted into existing spaces with minimal effort, and usually sounds quieter.</b></p>
								<p>On the other hand, this might also reduce the power it uses and the level of heating that it can offer: improving efficiency but reducing overall strength.</p>
								<p>Neither is necessarily better than the other, it just comes down to personal preference and the number of items in your home that will need hot water or higher water pressure to operate.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-73" id="title-73">
								<h2>Quality of the boiler</h2>
								<p>Many of the best combi's will be the ones built to a high standard of quality. There are rarely any times where a low-quality boiler is better unless it is far cheaper, and in most cases, a single high-quality combi boiler can cost less than having to replace a low-quality option multiple times.</p>
								<p>If you have the option, always go for the better-quality models if they are available, and be sure to look up any common issues with the boiler before you decide to purchase it.</p>
								<p>Warranties can matter a lot, too, since they will sometimes make up for a drop in quality by allowing you to get a replacement or repair job done.</p>

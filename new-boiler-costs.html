								  <p>There are some other factors that can affect the price of a new boiler installation, including the warranty length, labor costs, and how complicated the installation process is.</p>
								  <p>This will all differ based on the type of boiler that is best for your home and the company you go through.</p>

								<h2>Some factors that can influence the price of your new boiler.</h2>
								<p>You will be given a specific quote from the boiler installation company based on:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> The type of home you have (i.e. terraced, semi-detached, etc.)</li>
									<li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> How many bedrooms you have</li>

								<p>There are some factors that should come as no surprise to you when looking into a new boiler cost, like the fact that premium models will come with premium prices and complex installation process will cost you a pretty penny.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-04" id="title-04">
								<h2>Location can be a big cost factor</h2>
								<p>If you live in London, then you should expect to pay a much higher rate for a new boiler than someone who lives further up north, but isn't this always the case?</p>
								<p>It is recommended that you try to <a href="">get an instant boiler cost and quote online</a> or directly from the boiler company so you can get a good idea of how much you will need to budget and put away for a new boiler.</p>

							</section>
							<section class="title-05" id="title-05">
								<h2>Ok, What Am I Paying For Here?</h2>
								<p>No matter how long it takes for the new boiler to be installed into your home, you will face standard labour costs. These costs can differ based on the gas company you use and whether you have an insurance plan with them, but either way, the engineers doing the job will need to get paid.</p>
								<p>Usually, labour costs will be based on an average and an estimation of the time it will take to complete the job.</p>
								<p>As well as labour costs, you may face charges for any additional parts that need to be installed along with the cost of the new boiler itself.</p>
								<p>For example, if the pipework needs to be replaced before the new combi boiler can be installed, then you will not only face additional labour charges for this but also potentially the cost of materials too.</p>

								<h2>How much does a new boiler cost to replace?</h2>
								<p>In most cases, you will be looking into getting a new boiler as a replacement for the one that you currently have in your home such as an immersion heater.</p>
								<p>It is very important for you to have a reliable and working boiler in your home all year round to keep your family safe and warm. With this in mind, you may be looking to replace your old boiler with a new combi one as these are more reliable.</p>		
							</section>
							<section class="title-07" id="title-07">
								<h2>New vs Replacement Boiler Costs</h2>
								<p>When you are getting your boiler replaced, the costs are not reduced, and you will still face the same charges as those buying a brand new boiler system.</p>
								<p>This is because when it comes to replacing a boiler, you will need to pay for a new combi boiler to be installed as well as the cost of the boiler.</p>
								<p>For new boiler replacements, it might be possible that the installation charges differ greatly as they are based on the amount of work the engineer has to do. Replacing a boiler might make the process easier, as the new boiler can be installed on the water mains in the same manner as the old one, but this is not always a guarantee.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-08" id="title-08">
								<h2>Full System Conversion Boiler Prices</h2>
								<p>If you are trying to replace your old gas system boiler with a new combi boiler model or something completely different like an immersion heater, then you can expect high installation costs because of the work involved in this process.</p>

								<div class="video-wrapper">

								</div>

								<p><b>For example</b>, if the engineer needs to change the pipework or the location of your new boiler system before it can be installed, then this can be a costly and timely process.</p>
								<p>Other costs to consider when it comes to replacing a boiler, along with the cost of labour from the engineer, are a system cleanse. This is something the engineer will perform before installing the new pipework and the new boiler to your home.</p>
								<p>Depending on where you get your new boiler from and the type you choose, you may be encouraged to buy a new filter system to help it run better. <b>On average, this can add £100 to £200 to the total price of new combi boiler costs.</b></p>

								<h2>When Should I Replace My Boiler?</h2>
								<p><b>Boilers should be replaced every 10 to 15 years, even if they are still running decently after this time.</b></p>
								<p>Like most things, boilers are not made to last forever, which is why they need to be replaced after a decade or so of being used. This will ensure that your home is operating safely and will continue to give you access to heating when required.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-10" id="title-10">
								<h2>When is the best time to replace my boiler?</h2>
								<p>If you boiler is broken or on its last legs then you should seek to get it replace as soon as possible, otherwise..</p>
								<p>Your boiler replacement should probably take place in the summer.</p>
								<p>You might ask why in the summer?</p>

								<ul>
									<li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Boiler engineers are less busy in the summer</li>
									<li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Less reliant on the boiler during the summer months</li>
									<li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> You can stay warm whilst your new boiler is being installed</li>
									<li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Even if your boiler is not broken you should still look to replace your boiler every 10-15 years.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Otherwise… it can result in further issues in your home, as well as leaving you without access to central heating or hot water until the engineer can come out.</p>
								<p>It is not safe to leave a broken boiler unattended in your home, and it can make your house feel very uncomfortable – especially during the winter.</p>
								<p>This is why the best time to have a new boiler installed or get a system check-up is during the summer, as this is when the demand for central heating, at least, is less high.</p>
								<p>Depending on the issues you may be having with your boiler, your location, and other variables, it could take some time before an engineer can come to your property.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-11" id="title-11">
								<h2>Emergency Next Day Installation</h2>
								<p>Most gas companies will offer emergency appointments and callouts, should your boiler need immediate repair, but you still have to wait hours at least before anything can be done. This time may be extended if your boiler needs certain parts to repair it or your full system needs to be replaced.</p>
								<p>Emergency appointments are also expensive, which is why regular maintenance of your boiler is recommended to prevent issues early on.</p>

							<section class="title-12" id="title-12">
								<h2>What actually is a combi boiler?</h2>
								<p>A combi boiler, or a combination boiler, can do multiple jobs at once, as the name suggests. This kind of combi boiler will control both your hot water and your heating, which is why they are more efficient and reliable.</p>
								<p>Combi boilers will deliver hot water and heating instantly on-demand as they do not require a hot cylinder to be heated up beforehand.</p>
								<p>These kinds of boilers are preferred nowadays as they can really make a difference to your home and ensure that you will always be warm and cozy whenever you need to be.</p>
								<p>With this information in mind, it is very likely that you will want to replace your old boiler with a shiny new combi model instead.</p>
								<p>If this applies to you, then you will be looking to convert your regular boiler to a combi one; which is essentially industry-speak for replacing your boiler.</p>
								<p>Converting a boiler can cost between £2,500 and £4,500 depending on the company you choose and other needs we mentioned earlier.</p>
								<p>Replacing your combi boiler is something that is top of the priority list for most homeowners in the United Kingdom, so we know what kind of demand we are dealing with here.</p>
								<p>It is important to note that replacing a boiler can be quite a complicated process, so you should expect the high prices that will come with such a project.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-13" id="title-13">
								<h2>What am I paying for here?</h2>
								<p>When it comes to replacing an old boiler for a new combi one, there are a lot of steps involved, which is why it can be quite expensive.</p>
								<p>To keep things simple, replacing a boiler includes:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color: rgb(40, 167, 69);"></i> Full removal of your old boiler system and water cylinder</li>
									<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color: rgb(40, 167, 69);"></i> Upgraded and new pipework fed into the existing location or a new one if required</li>
									<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color: rgb(40, 167, 69);"></i> The price of your new boiler itself</li>
								</ul>

								<p>There are some other fees that can come with this service but that doesn't mean that it isn't worth it.</p>
								<p>Replacing a combi boiler is a big job that can take a couple of days and two or more engineers in your home, for simple combi swaps this can be done in as little as half a day.</p>

								<h2>Types of new boilers available</h2>
								<p>There are lots of different brands and models available to choose from when considering having a new boiler installed, it can be quite overwhelming for a novice to wade through.</p>
								<p>The boiler engineer should be able to guide you to the best model for your home, so make sure you take their advice. They will consider the kind of house you have, but may not necessarily consider your budget so make this clear.</p>
								<p>When looking into new boilers, there are lots of different complicated names out there.</p>
								<p><b><a href="">iHeat</a> have lots of models on offer, but here are some of their main brands that you will probably have to choose from:</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color: rgb(40, 167, 69);"></i> Viessmann Vitodens 050-W 29kw</li>

								<h1>How much do new regular/system boilers cost?</h1>
								<h2>Between £1,500 and £3,000</h2>
								<p>A new regular boiler (also known as a system boiler in the industry) can cost between £1,500 and £3,000 depending on the factors we have already mentioned.</p>
								<p>You will not be able to get a clear quote unless you speak directly with the boiler company and give them information regarding your own personal situation.</p>
								<p>The final amount of installing a regular boiler into your home can be affected by various different factors:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color: rgb(40, 167, 69);"></i> The brand of the boiler</li>
									<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color: rgb(40, 167, 69);"></i> The warranty length (iHeat offers form 5 - 10 year warranties)</li>
									<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color: rgb(40, 167, 69);"></i> Required controls (wireless or wired)</li>
									<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color: rgb(40, 167, 69);"></i> Any additional pumps or valves needed</li>
									<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color: rgb(40, 167, 69);"></i> The complexity of the job (such as removing of an old tank)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Regular or system boilers require a water cylinder in order to work, which is one of the main differences between these and combi boilers.</p>
								<p>This means that a water cylinder will also have to be installed into your home, which will, of course, come with additional costs.
								</p>
								<p>The figures we have given, as well as those that you will likely be given from a boiler company, only cover the installation of the regular boiler, not the water cylinder.</p>
								<p>So you will need to sure that you have enough in the bank to cover your new boiler installation and then some if you are looking to get a regular or system one.</p>

								<h1>How much does a back boiler to combi conversion cost?</h1>
								<h2>Between £3,000 and £5,000</h2>
								<p>If you are currently dealing with a broken back boiler in your home, then you really need to get someone in to sort it out. This is a problem that no modern home should be dealing with.</p>
								<p>Back boilers have had their days in the sun, but now they are causing more problems than they are worth.</p>
								<p>These kinds of boilers can no longer be repaired in accordance with the modern regulations boilers now need to keep up with, so there really is nothing you can do about this problem other than replacing it with a new combi boiler.</p>
								<p>In most cases, replacing a back boiler with a combi one can cost anywhere between £3,000 and £5,000.</p>

							</section>
							<section class="title-17" id="title-17">
								<h2>Any Additional Costs?</h2>
								<p>Most companies will also have an additional fee on top of this when it comes to replacing a back boiler.</p>
								<p>This is because this is such a complicated process and the pricing needs to reflect that.</p>
								<p>The quote that you receive from some boiler companies may not include this additional fee, so make sure you have a bit more in the bank than they are asking for to keep yourself covered.</p>

							</section>
							<section class="title-18" id="title-18">
								<h2>Whats Involved In A Conversion?</h2>
								<p>The actual process of converting a back boiler system to a combi boiler one is quite similar to any other boiler replacement, as it also includes the entire removal of your current boiler before the new one can be installed, just the cost may differ.</p>
								<p><b>This includes replacing the pipework and all of the other complicated bits that go with a boiler, you wont get any hidden costs with us.</b></p>
								<p>However, the fact that a back boiler is inconveniently located behind your fireplace makes this a very complicated task and one that most companies do not enjoy doing.</p>
								<p>This is why you can expect a much higher cost of boiler for this kind of boiler service, as there are more steps involved than replacing the system with a new boiler.</p>
								<p>Most boiler companies will charge such high prices for this kind of service as it makes the task slightly easier to bear when you know there will be a nice pay-check at the end of it.</p>

							<section class="title-19" id="title-19">
								<h1>How much does boiler installation cost?</h1>
								<h2>Between £500 - £2000</h2>
								<p>Typically a boiler installer could charge you between £500 - £2000 just for the labour of your new boiler installation thats if its a gas system, the new boiler costs can vary heavily for LPG or Oil.</p>
								<p>iHeat includes this in the price with the combi boilers.</p>

							</section>
							<section class="title-20" id="title-20">
								<h2>What other costs should I be aware of?</h2>
								<p>When purchasing a new boiler you should note the possible hidden charges or the cost of items you may not be aware of.</p>
								<ul>
									<li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> The boiler (gas ot LPG)</li>
									<li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Full labour for the boiler install</li>

								<h1>How long should a new boiler last?</h1>
								<h2>Around 10-15 years</h2>
								<p>As you can see, replacing or installing a new combi boiler can cost a lot of money, so you want to make sure that it is worth it every penny.</p>
								<p>Luckily, gas combi boilers aren't something that you need to be buying on a regular basis as they are made to last around 10-15 years.</p>
								<p>This is an average figure and one that applies to standard homes who use their boilers as regularly as you would expect a normal family home to do so.</p>
								<p>Of course, there will be some exceptions to this, but as a standard rule of thumb, your boiler should last you at least a decade.</p>
								<p>This lifespan applies to all fuel boilers, such as oil, gas, and LPG, as well as all combi and standard.</p>
								<p>This means that no matter what kind of boiler you choose for your home, you should be able to keep it warm and cozy for at least a decade before forking out for it all over again.</p>
								<p>Typically you should be aiming for a 5-10 year warranty on your boiler, this will cover you through the manufacturer if there are any faults on your new boiler.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="title-22" id="title-22">
								<h2>How long does it take to install a new boiler?</h2>
								<p>As we have mentioned, it can take some time before an engineer is available to come out to your address unless you are making an emergency call-out.</p>
								<p>However, this is not the only time delay that you will have to consider when it comes to either getting a new boiler or replacing your old one.</p>
								<p>The average time it takes to install a standard combi boiler into a home is between four and six hours, but of course, there are regular variations on this.</p>

								<p>Those who are looking to replace their combi boiler with a new model can expect the engineer to work for around four hours. This is only the case for straightforward swaps with like-to-like boilers, such as replacing an older combi with the newer model.</p>
								<p>These times do not include any additional delays that may come about when buying a new combi boiler, such as replacing pipework or changing the location of the entire boiler system. For older homes, a new combi boiler will likely need to be installed in a new location of the home.</p>

								<h2>Replacing Boilers In Older Homes</h2>
								<p>Modern combi boilers typically get installed in the kitchen, but if you have an older gas model, then this might be a completely different change.</p>
								<p>This means that as well as the standard four to six hours required for installation, additional time will need to be added on where the engineer needs to tear everything out and start again. In some cases, this can go on over several days, depending on the severity of the job.</p>
								<p>The average time it takes to replace an old boiler system with a combi one is two days. These times can differ based on your location and availability of the gas company, as areas with higher demand will have to deal with longer time delays.</p>

								<h2>Can I get a free boiler?</h2>
								<p>The best things in life are said to be free and if you're a bargain hunter like most of the nation, you will be trying your hardest to get a new boiler without having to open your wallet.</p>
								<p>Believe it or not, but it could actually be possible for you to get your hands on a shiny new boiler for free.</p>
								<p>However, this doesn't apply to everyone and, as you can imagine, there are some strict requirements in place to see whether it is something that you actually need.</p>
								<p>The UK Government has enrolled an Eco Scheme in 2019 that allows some qualifying homeowners to have their old boiler systems replaced with something that actually works.</p>
								<p>This can come free of charge or at a cost that has been significantly cut based on your circumstances and how you qualify.</p>
								<p>If you do qualify for this service, the government will arrange for a local engineer to come round your house and install a new (probable combi) boiler system in your home.</p>
								<p>This is a plan that has been aimed at those who are the most worse off in our society to ensure that everyone has access to a warm and safe home - which is vital in our ever-changing weather conditions!</p>
								<p>There are various regulations in place, as we have mentioned, including the kind of benefits that are supported and the postcodes that qualify.</p>
								<p>You may qualify for a free or vastly reduced new combi boiler in your home, so make sure you take some time to fill out the relevant applications as this isn't something you want to miss out on. This is a free to use service, so there really is nothing to lose.</p>
								<p>It is important to note that new boiler grants are only available to homeowners who have properties with a mains gas supply. This grant is no longer available to landlords or tenants.</p>
